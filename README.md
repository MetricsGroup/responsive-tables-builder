Responsive data tables -- tables of information that are still readable even at small screen widths -- can be tricky. There are [a lot of solutions out there](#resources). This one picks an option that is mobile-first, does not require JS, allows for multiple "levels" of data, and is presented in a readable list form at small screen widths. Like so:

One drawback to this solution, though, is that it relies on column headers being inserted into the HTML as data attributes, which is a pain if you have a lot of rows of information to present.

This tool consumes raw data files, runs them through the responsive tables template, and gives you HTML and CSS you can drop in place.

# Features

* Prepare the data you want to display in structured data files, without having to worry about the necessary HTML code.
* Semantic and accessibility-focused HTML output, without any need for JavaScript.
* Tables are perfectly readable even if CSS never loads, and progressively enhanced for modern browsers while being fully compatible with old ones.
* Mobile-first, unlike some responsive solutions out there.
* Styling is done through Sass files, with variables that you can easily update to change things like breakpoints, colors, and spacing.
* CSS can optionally be included directly in the resulting HTML file -- so you can drop it in all together, for instance in hosted solutions or CMSes where you don't have control over the site-wide CSS files.
